/** \brief Edge detection
 *
 * During the R_Low State, R phase is being polled to find a stable HIGH level.
 * As the previous state was reached after a period with a stable LOW level, it is clear
 * that after finding a HIGH level, a rising edge occurred, so the zero crossing
 * of the phase took place and we can transition to the R_HIGH state.
 *
 * Previous state: R_Sync
 * Next states: R_High, PhaseFailure
